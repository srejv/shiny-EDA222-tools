All libraries licenses are their own.

My own code is under the "use with caution but srsly, it's only js and html". I'm adding a better license soon, suggestions are welcome. (Open for use, modification, pull requests and everything else.)

I do not, however, offer support. I will try to make everything easily usable, clear and add helptext and documentation and all that. Easily explorable. I'm not sure about undo-ing stuff....
